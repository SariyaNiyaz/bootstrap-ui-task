## 🧠 Learning Process (Step-by-Step)
1. Explored Bootstrap 5 documentation and example templates.  
2. Selected components like navbars, cards, carousels, forms, and icons.  
3. Designed each page by remixing Bootstrap components—not copy-pasting full templates.  
4. Applied custom spacing, container layout, and responsive utilities.  
5. Used grid system (`row`, `col`) to structure sections.  
6. Added external links and images for realistic UI content.  
7. Created project folder in VS Code and managed it using Git.  
8. Uploaded the project to GitHub and deployed through GitHub Pages.

## 🤝 External Tools & Assistance  
I used the following tools for guidance and support:

- **Bootstrap 5 Documentation** (for layout, components, grids)  
- **ChatGPT** (for clarifying component usage and generating README)  
- **Bootstrap Examples** for UI inspiration  

All components were customized and integrated manually based on understanding.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### **1. Carousel Image Alignment**
- Issue: Images were uneven and breaking layout  
- Solution: Added `height: 500px` and `object-fit: cover` to fix proportions  

### **2. Structuring Cards on About Page**
- Issue: Uneven heights and spacing  
- Solution: Used Bootstrap columns and utility classes  

### **3. Making Contact Page Modern**
- Issue: Raw Bootstrap form looked plain  
- Solution: Added shadows, custom padding, and icons
