📝 Project Reflection
1. How I Completed the Project (Step-by-Step)

First, I created the basic folder structure: index.html, about.html, contact.html, and an assets folder.

I added Bootstrap 5 using the official CDN.

I explored Bootstrap’s official documentation and Examples section to understand layouts, components, and utilities.

I selected key UI components such as Navbar, Carousel, Cards, Forms, and used them to design my pages.

I built the Home Page with a navbar and carousel, the About Page with education & internship cards, and the Contact Page with a form and contact details.

I ensured responsiveness using Bootstrap grid and utility classes.

Finally, I pushed the project to GitHub and deployed it using GitHub Pages.

2. Use of External Tools

Yes, I used Bootstrap Documentation for layout ideas and component references.

I used ChatGPT to clarify doubts, improve content, and format the README.

I used some code snippets from Bootstrap examples but modified and combined them to create my own unique pages.

3. Challenges Faced

Understanding Git & GitHub commands (push, pull, creating repo, deployment).

Making the carousel images responsive and setting consistent height.

Adjusting Bootstrap card layouts to fit neatly on all screen sizes.

Deploying the site on GitHub Pages and fixing repository name settings.

4. How I Solved Them

I referred to GitHub docs and used ChatGPT to understand Git errors.

Used object-fit: cover to maintain carousel image layout.

Applied Bootstrap grid system (col, row, container) to manage spacing.

Followed Bootstrap examples to adjust layout issues.

Corrected GitHub Pages settings to match the repository name.

5. Learning Outcomes

Learned how to work with Bootstrap 5 components effectively.

Improved my UI design understanding with responsive layouts.

Gained practical experience with Git & GitHub version control.
